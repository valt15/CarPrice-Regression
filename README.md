## Introduction

The car company wants to enter a new market and needs an estimation of exactly which variables affect the car prices.
The goal is:
  - Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car?

## Data Source
This data set is taken from Kaggle:
  - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-predictio
## Features
This is a very detailed and explanatory project for beginners who are looking to get their hands dirty with Exploratory Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, and Linear Regression.

- Exploratory Data Analysis of Categorical and Numerical Variables.
## Learnings

The first real project I worked on, taught me several things:
- Getting comfortable with working with a relatively large and noisy dataset.
- Using and showcasing several Python techniques and libraries:
  1. Numpy
  2. Pandas
  3. Scipy
  4. Matplotlib
  5. Seaborn
  6. Scikit Learn
- Using techniques like:
  1. Outlier Detection
  2. Identifying Input Features and Target Variables.
  3. Visualizing different graphs for different variables.
  4. Visualizing relationships amongst different variables.
- Using Regression Performance Metrics to check the accuracy of our model:
    1. Mean Absolute Error
    2. Mean Squared Error
    3. R2 Score
- Employing Gradient Descent to build the second Multiple Linear Regression Model.
- Feature Engineering:
  1. Introducing new features from the existing ones to prevent overfitting and save computational resources.
  2. Since introducing new features may increase the chances of introducing Multi-Collinearity in the dataset.
  3. Checking for Multi-Collinearity through Heatmap and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).
  4. Choosing relevant features for the second model.
- Feature Scaling
  1. Using Z-Score Normalization to scale the input features for a better and more accurate model.
	2. Using Pipeline and ColumnTransformer to scale the input features
- Using Gradient Descent to build the second model.
- Visualising the predictions and actual values via scatterplot.
- Using Regression Performance Metrics to check the accuracy of our model:
  1. Mean Absolute Error
  2. Mean Squared Error
  3. R2 Score
